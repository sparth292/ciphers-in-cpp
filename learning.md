1. Caesar Cipher - iterate the string, add three to every character of the string and print/store the final character at every iteration

2. Mono Alphabetic Cipher - A monoalphabetic cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced with a fixed, unique letter in     the ciphertext using a single, predetermined mapping or key.

3. Homophonic Substitution Cipher - In this technique one plain text alphabet can map to more than one cipher text alphabet.

   Mono vs Homo, Whatâ€™s the Real Difference?

4. Atbash Cipher - The Atbash cipher is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher that works by reversing the alphabet, mapping the first letter to the last, the second    to the second-to-last, and so on.

5. Vinegere Cipher - Method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.
