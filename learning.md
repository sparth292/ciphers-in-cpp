1.Caesar Cipher - iterate the string, add three to every character of the string and print/store the final character at every iteration

2.Mono Alphabetic Cipher - Mono alphabetic ciphers pose a difficult problem
for a cryptanalyst because it can be very difficult
to crack thanks to the high number of possible
permutations and combinations.
